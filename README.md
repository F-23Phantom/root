This Marlin XT-17V bedding block works really well when cut from aluminum. It can probably also work pretty well if made of plastic on a 3D printer, so I added an STL version to the repository.

To install this bedding block in the stock you will need to drill the hole for the 1/2" diameter forward lug out to 3/4".  Then route or mill the wood away for the rectangular upper portion.  Square the corners with a chisel.  It should be routed down deep enough so the bottom of the barrel channel in the block lines up with the bottom of the barrel channel in the stock.  You'll notice the bottom of the barrel channel is a little higher near the forward mounting lug.  It will stop the action from wandering around in the stock when you shoot.
