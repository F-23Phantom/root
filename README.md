This works really well when cut out of aluminum, but it can also work pretty well made on a 3D printer.  So I added an STL version to the repository.

To install this bedding block in the stock you will need to drill the hole for the 1/2" diameter forward lug out to 3/4th inch.  
Then route or mill the wood away for the rectangular upper portion.  It should be routed down deep enough so the bottom of the barrel channel
in the block lines up with the bottom of the barrel channel in the stock.  It will stop the action from wandering around in the stock when you shoot.
